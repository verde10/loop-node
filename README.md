# loop-node

A decentralized IoT node management system on the Stacks blockchain for secure and transparent node registration and tracking.

## Overview

Loop-node provides a comprehensive framework for managing IoT nodes on the Stacks blockchain, enabling:

- Secure node registration and identity verification
- Real-time status monitoring and tracking
- Data verification and validation
- Performance-based rewards for node operators
- Decentralized governance for network parameters

## Smart Contract Architecture

The system consists of four main smart contracts that work together:

### Node Registry Contract
Handles the fundamental operations of node management:
- Node registration and ownership tracking
- Status updates and lifecycle management
- Metadata and capability management
- Location tracking
- Network statistics

### Data Verification Contract
Ensures data integrity and authenticity:
- Challenge-response verification system
- Data submission validation
- Audit trail maintenance
- Suspicious activity flagging
- Historical verification records

### Node Rewards Contract
Implements the incentive mechanism:
- Performance-based token rewards
- Reputation scoring
- Automated reward distribution
- Bonus reward mechanisms
- Activity tracking

### Governance Contract
Enables decentralized decision-making:
- Proposal creation and voting
- Parameter updates
- Protocol changes
- Authorization policy management
- Emergency controls

## Key Features

- **Secure Registration**: Cryptographic verification of node identity
- **Status Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of node activity and health
- **Data Integrity**: Challenge-response system for data verification
- **Incentive System**: Token rewards based on performance and reliability
- **Decentralized Control**: Community governance of network parameters
- **Transparent Operations**: All activities recorded on-chain
- **Flexible Architecture**: Extensible design for future enhancements

## Contract Functions

### Node Registry

```clarity
;; Register a new node
(register-node (node-id (buff 32)) (location (optional (tuple (latitude (string-utf8 40)) (longitude (string-utf8 40))))) (capabilities (list 10 (string-utf8 64))) (firmware-version (string-utf8 32)) (metadata (buff 1024)))

;; Update node status
(update-node-status (node-id (buff 32)) (new-status uint))

;; Transfer node ownership
(transfer-node-ownership (node-id (buff 32)) (new-owner principal))
```

### Data Verification

```clarity
;; Request verification challenge
(request-challenge)

;; Submit data with verification
(submit-data (data-hash (buff 32)) (challenge-response (buff 32)) (metadata (optional (string-utf8 500))))

;; Flag suspicious data
(flag-submission (submission-id (buff 32)) (reason (string-utf8 200)))
```

### Node Rewards

```clarity
;; Claim earned rewards
(claim-rewards (node-id (buff 32)))

;; Submit performance metrics
(submit-performance-metrics (node-id (buff 32)) (uptime uint) (quality uint) (contribution uint))
```

### Governance

```clarity
;; Create proposal
(create-proposal (title (string-ascii 100)) (description (string-utf8 1000)) (proposal-type uint) (parameter-key (optional (string-ascii 50))) (parameter-value (optional (string-utf8 200))) (contract-change (optional (string-ascii 50))))

;; Vote on proposal
(vote-on-proposal (proposal-id uint) (vote-for bool))

;; Execute approved proposal
(execute-proposal (proposal-id uint))
```

## Getting Started

To interact with the loop-node system:

1. Register a node using the node registry contract
2. Configure node capabilities and metadata
3. Begin submitting verified data
4. Earn rewards based on performance
5. Participate in governance decisions

## Security Considerations

- Node registration requires cryptographic proof of ownership
- Data submissions must pass verification challenges
- Reward claims have cooldown periods
- Governance proposals require minimum stake
- Emergency controls for critical issues

## Development

This project is built with Clarity smart contracts for the Stacks blockchain. More implementation details and development guidelines will be added as the project evolves.
